# TypeScript Sandbox

## Compilation
First, globally install the TypeScript compiler with ``npm i -g typescript``.

Compile once with ``tsc sandbox.ts``.

Watch a file and compile on save with ``tsc sandbox.ts -w``.

Watch and compile all files on save with ``tsc -w``, as long as you have a src folder specified in ``tsconfig.json``.
